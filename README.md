### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Optional
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
- If you don't have nodemon installed you can change the start script in the `package.json` to `"node server/server.js"`

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend_to_do_app`,
2. The queries in the `weekend_to_do_app.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open your editor and run `npm install` in your terminal - this will install express, pg, and bootstrap.
2. run `npm start` in your terminal. (Default port is 5000, if port is in use modify `server.js` port variable.)
3. Navigate to `localhost:5000` in browser (if port was modified, use redifined port number)

## Usage

1. As a user, I want to be able to add a task to my to-do list
2. As a user, I want to be able to add details to my tasks
3. As a user, I want to be able to add a priority level to my tasks.
4. As a user, I want to be able to edit my tasks
5. As a user, I want to be able to delete my tasks
6. As a user, I want to be able to mark tasks complete
